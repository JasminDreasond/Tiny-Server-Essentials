# 🌐 Tiny Server Essentials

**A modular and strict toolkit for building scalable Express v5 + Socket.IO v4 apps with ease.**

---

## 🧠 What is this?

This project is a **collection of reusable server-side modules** designed to simplify and improve how you build modern real-time applications using:

* ✅ **Express v5** (modern middleware chaining)
* 🔄 **Socket.IO v4** (reliable WebSocket communication)
* 🧩 **Strict helpers** and **validation tools** to interconnect both layers with minimal effort

Instead of creating everything from scratch, this toolkit provides **well-structured classes and utilities** that speed up development while promoting clarity and separation of concerns.

---

## 🚀 What can it do?

With this toolkit, you can:

* ⚙️ Manage a single unified HTTP(S) server for both REST and WebSockets
* 🌍 Register and validate domain names for secure multi-tenant setups
* 🧾 Normalize, extract and match IP addresses with fallback strategies
* 📡 Simplify bi-directional communication logic using Socket.IO over a clean `TinyIo` wrapper
* 🧪 See it all in action with fully working examples

---

## 🗂️ Where is everything?

You can find detailed documentation about each module in the [docs overview](./docs), where all core components like Express, Instance, Io, and Utils are explained clearly.

Also see [`/docs/client`](./docs/client) for browser-related features like 🎙️ mic volume filters!

---

## 🧪 Test It Yourself!

Looking for real use cases? Check out the [`test/servers`](./test/servers) folder for **simple and working examples** of how to:

* 🧵 Combine Express and Socket.IO on the same port
* 🧩 Integrate all modules for production-style setups
* 🔁 Test domain validation, IP filters, and WebSocket events

Just clone, install, and run a test server to see the magic in action! ✨

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Node.js** (18+ recommended)
* **Express v5**
* **Socket.IO v4**
